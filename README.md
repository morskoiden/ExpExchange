ExpExchange is a plugin that allows players to convert their experience levels into bottled items. Players can open an exchange menu using a command, where they can trade their XP levels and an empty glass bottle for a custom experience bottle. When the bottled item is used, it grants the player the stored amount of experience levels. The plugin supports three exchange tiers: 15, 30, and 45 levels. All messages, item names, and lore can be customized through the configuration file.
